Commit to your goals and actually get them done


Just Commit helps you to make real commitments in your day-to-day life by  recording a simple video message for yourself to watch later.

That could be as simple as "by 6pm, I should have put the bins out", or "by the end of the week, I'm going to have had 0 cigarettes". Whatever your goals are, Just Commit will make sure they get done by transferring  them from your mind into something tangible. The real, face-to-face feedback you get from watching yourself committing to something you haven't done yet will be all the motivation you need to get it done next time.

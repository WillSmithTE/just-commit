   - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-flash-message
TESTING- no notification icon
- colour of the recording button, should be white but is gray
- don't start with "it's early days"
- voice recorder instead of video? switch mode somehow. bottom left video signal? click to show 3 options?
   - https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/fab-group.html
   - choose your own background for voice recordings?
- type a commitment instead of recording one?
- reward system to check off if you  did it (duolingo  style? animation, sound?)
   - swipe to say i did it on home screen, then it  disappears?
- recurring one (every day? google calendar style)
- to share: sends video, sends title and notification time in message. share with  a friend  on messenger
   - https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/sharing/
- wording for notification. completion  time? deadline?
- is notification and deadline different?
DONE - add library
- have to  add deadline? non optional?
-  guides you  through i t after  recording. when's this due? do you want to be  notified? with a little back button
   - tik does video playback with "next" button bottom right. Then do everything there. could do? no modal at all? 
      theirs is a little busy
DONE- right arrow bottom right,  x in top left for exit
- what to do on tap? tik tok will do: tap? show square with expanded border. hold? only expanded border, nothing inside
DONE- it's a NAME not a title
- performance of record button
- newsfeed with your friends/celebs. pay to see the celebs?
- should pause/play just be on click on screen?
- home just has upcoming stuff?
- video flipped
- save modal lag before closing
- save modal looks ugly
- why just loading on playback after tap? need to do the error handling
